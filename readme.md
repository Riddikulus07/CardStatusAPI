# Card Status API Application README

Welcome to the Card Status API application! This repository contains the source code for an API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The API allows users to retrieve card status information based on card ID or user contact.

## Overview

The Card Status API serves as a centralized system for managing card status information. It provides endpoints to retrieve card status based on card ID or user contact.

## Approach

### Framework/Language Choice

The project is built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend server and routing. MongoDB is chosen as the database to store card status information.

**Rationale for Framework/Language Choice:**
- **Node.js:** Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it suitable for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** It's a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing simplicity, robustness, and flexibility in building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** Chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration with Node.js applications.

### Architecture

The architecture follows a layered approach with separation of concerns:
- **Routes:** Handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate processing to controllers.
- **Controllers:** Contain business logic and interact with the database.
- **Models:** Define the schema and interact directly with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

### Docker

The application is containerized using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.

**Dockerfile:** Defines the environment for running the Node.js application inside a Docker container.

**docker-compose.yaml:** Composes the services needed for the application, including the API service and MongoDB database.

## Possible Improvements

1. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide better feedback to users.
2. **Authentication and Authorization:** Integrate authentication and authorization mechanisms for securing access to sensitive endpoints.
3. **Validation:** Implement request validation to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious input.
4. **Logging:** Enhance logging to capture application events and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting.
5. **Testing:** Increase test coverage by implementing unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

Certainly! Here's an expanded section on how to run the API application:

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
   - Node.js and npm: You can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Docker: Follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/card-status-api.git
   ```
   Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd card-status-api
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Use npm to install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configuration:**
   Update the MongoDB connection string in `compose.yaml` with your MongoDB database credentials. Replace `your-mongodb-uri>` with your MongoDB Atlas URI.

5. **Running the Application:**

   ### Option 1: Running Locally
   If you want to run the application locally:

   - Start the MongoDB service on your machine or use a remote MongoDB instance.

   - Start the Node.js server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.

   ### Option 2: Running with Docker Compose
   If you prefer to use Docker Compose for containerized deployment:

   - Make sure Docker is running on your machine.

   - Start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

6. **Accessing the API:**

   Once the application is running:
   - If you're running the application locally, access the API at `http://localhost:3001`.
   - If you're running the application with Docker Compose, access the API at `http://localhost:3001`.

   You can use tools like Postman to interact with the API endpoints and perform CRUD operations.

7. **Stopping the Application:**
   To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the Node.js server is running. If using Docker Compose, run the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
